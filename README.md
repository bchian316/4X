General tip: if a button is gray, it means you don't have enough money or resources
if a button is red, then something else is wrong
Units:
  Units are spawned from cities
  Units can perform actions off of their action sequences
  Units have varying attack, defense, movement, range, cost, health, regeneration rate, action sequences, and abilities
  Terrain and enemy units can block unit movement
  After the unit performs its sequence, it is immovable until the next turn
Player:
  Players can perform actions on any location inhabited by a unit (grow, harvest, cultivate, chop)
  Players can build and upgrade buildings on any location inhabited by a unit
Terrain:
  The map has a pre-set generated terrain of mountain, forest, water, ocean, and plains
  The map also has other stuff like villages (cities), crop, and seaweed
  The map is hexagonal, and units can move in any of the 6 directions
Buildings:
  Buildings produce resources and can be built by players anywhere their units are
  Buildings have varying costs, production speed, possible terrain, and production
  Buildings are destroyed when opposing units move on them
  Buidlings can be upgraded into other buildings, which replace the original building
Cities:
  Cities are captured when moving on a village or an opposing city
  Cities can be upgraded to increase resource production, unit production, and unit cooldown
  Cities can spawn all researched units
  Cities have a production bar that is exhausted every time a unit is created
  Different units exhaust the bar in different amounts
  Cities cannot regenerate their exhaustion bar when units are on top of it
  Cities retain level when captured by enemies
Tech:
  Technology is researched by paying gold
  Technology allows for creation of new units, buildings, actions, and terrain movement
  Technology must be researched in specific order as certain techs must have preceding techs researched first
  More advanced technology costs more to research
Resources:
  There are 4 resources: money, wood, metal, and food
  Money is obtained mainly from cities
  Wood is obtained from cities, buildings, and chopping forests
  Metal is obtained from cities and buildings
  Food is obtained from cities, crop, and buildings
  More resources allow for greater flexibility in attacking and defense
Turn system:
  At the beginning of a player's turn, buildings and cities produce resources
  Some buildings take multiple turns to produce resources
  Units are all reset and gain the ability to do their sequences again
